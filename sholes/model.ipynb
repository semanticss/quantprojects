    "So, basically, the Black-Sholes model is a estimates the theoretical value of a given derivative\n",
    "based on explicit, discrete, external instruments. It (BSM) considers the impact of time until\n",
    "expiration as well as other risk factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is set up as a differential equation with respect to an arbirtary number of variables, each of which\n",
    "increase the complexity linearly. Only used to consider European-style options, as it does not consider\n",
    "the fact that American options can be exercised before the expiration date occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model posits the idea that instruments are distributed log-normally, which basically just means that\n",
    "they are the sort of normal in the positive x direction and positive y direction. This is because \n",
    "the option is essentially risk-free apart from the price of the option initially, which is sunk after\n",
    "purchase. It also assumes they follow a random walk (stochastic process) with a constant drift and a \n",
    "constant volatility. It is set up to predict the price of a CALL OPTION. There is an alternative equation\n",
    "that can be derived closed-form that predicts the price of a PUT OPTION. Other models of this nature include\n",
    "the binomial pricing model or the Monte-Carlo model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "        1. No dividends are paid out during the life of the option.\n",
    "        2. Markets are entirely random.\n",
    "        3. No transaction costs when purchasing the option (frictionless)\n",
    "        4. The risk-free rate and volatility are known and constant\n",
    "        5. The returns of the actual underlying assets are NORMALLY distributed (hence the lognormal of the option)\n",
    "        6. Option is European.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base BSM is given as: C =  (Current underlying price)(Normal distribution of d1) - (Strike price)(exp(-risk free rate * time to expiration))(Normal distribution d2)\n",
    "where d1 = (ln(current price / strike price) + (risk-free + ))"
